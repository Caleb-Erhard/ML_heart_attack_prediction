# Heart Attack Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project applies basic supervised machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a heart attack using a medical dataset derived from NHANES data.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to explore data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation in a healthcare context. The dataset contains patient health indicators, and models are trained to classify whether an individual is at risk of myocardial infarction.

## Files
- `Caleb-Erhard_ML_Project-1.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results.
- `NHANES_Data_P1_MI_train.csv` – Training dataset.
- `NHANES_Data_P1_MI_test.csv` – Test dataset.

## Methods
The notebook includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling and selection
- Training baseline machine learning models
- Model evaluation using standard classification metrics

## Results
Model performance is evaluated on a held-out test set. Metrics such as accuracy and other relevant classification measures are used to assess predictive performance.

## Requirements
This project was developed using Python with common data science libraries such as:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn

(Exact versions are not pinned.)

## Notes
This project was completed as part of an Applied Machine Learning course and is intended for educational purposes.
